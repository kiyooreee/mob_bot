## Robot Package Template

This is a GitHub template made from 'https://github.com/joshnewans/my_bot'. You can make your own copy by clicking the green "Use this template" button.

It is recommended that you keep the repo/package name the same, but if you do change it, ensure you do a "Find all" using your IDE (or the built-in GitHub IDE by hitting the `.` key) and rename all instances of `my_bot` to whatever your project's name is.

Note that each directory currently has at least one file in it to ensure that git tracks the files (and, consequently, that a fresh clone has direcctories present for CMake to find). These example files can be removed if required (and the directories can be removed if `CMakeLists.txt` is adjusted accordingly).



It was made to work with ROS2 Humble stable version. Kindly modify the urdf code if necessary based on your preferences.
I currently don't know the changes to be made to use it for ROS1 but will surely update in the future - kiyooreee
